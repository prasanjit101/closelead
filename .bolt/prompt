Here is more detailed context about the project that you are tasked to build:
<project>
Closelead is a lead management and automation tool ("Lead-to-Meeting Automation Platform.")

It can:
- Lead scoring and qualification
- Automated follow-up
- Appointment scheduling
- Simple pipeline tracking

## Flow

1. **Account Creation** → Email verification → Profile setup
2. **Webhook Configuration** → Generate unique webhook URL → Integration instructions
3. **Agent Configuration** → an agent is a set of configurations that define how the ai agents in the system will behave. Can be of type "response_agent, followup_agent" for now.
4. **Cal.com Integration** → Link verification → Webhook setup for appointments
5. **Template Setup** → Default templates provided → Customization options
6. **AI Scoring Configuration** → Field mapping → Scoring criteria setup

</project>


For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.
When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the "use client" directive at the top of the file.
Do not write code that will trigger this error: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"
By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.
Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Here are some additional guidelines to follow:
<guidelines>
- write elegant, clean, and maintainable code.
- keep the app well documented and organized.
- Add explanatory comments to the code where necessary.
- Use meaningful variable and function names relevant to the language.
- Use consistent naming conventions.
- When working on the frontend, ensure responsiveness and ensure that the UI is beautiful while being consistent with the rest of the UI.
- When working on the backend, ensure that the code is efficient and follows best practices for security and performance.
- When working on the database, ensure that the schema is well defined and follows best practices for data integrity and performance.
- Always use the latest version of the libraries and frameworks unless mentioned otherwise in the documentation, package.json or by the user.
- please do not delete any files or code to fix the errors. Instead ask the user when you are not sure about what to do.
- Don't implement long files. Instead try to break down large code into separate components or files or modules
</guidelines>
